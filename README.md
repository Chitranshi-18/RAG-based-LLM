# üß† Legal Search with Explanations

A powerful Streamlit web application for semantic search over legal documents with AI-generated explanations. This project integrates cutting-edge embedding models, ANN search, neural reranking, and LLM-based explanation generation to help users efficiently find and understand relevant legal provisions.

## üöÄ Overview

## üöÄ Overview

- **Ollama Embeddings**: Uses Ollama's "nomic-embed-text" model to convert legal text into semantic vectors.  
- **ChromaDB ANN Search**: Employs ChromaDB for fast approximate nearest neighbor retrieval with optimized HNSW indexing.  
- **Cross-Encoder Reranking**: Applies a dense cross-encoder (ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2) for refining initial results.  
- **LLaMA 2 LLM Explanation Generation**: Calls Ollama's LLM (llama2:latest) to generate concise, human-readable explanations for each search result on demand.  
- **Streamlit UI**: Interactive, clean interface with query input, configurable top-k results, rerank scoring, and explanation display.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Efficient Embedding & Index Caching**: Uses Streamlit's @st.cache_resource decorator to avoid repeated embedding computation and index rebuilding across sessions.  
- **Batch Processing with Progress Bar**: Shows real-time progress during initial embedding and indexing.  
- **Configurable Top-K Results**: Adjustable slider to control number of displayed and reranked results.  
- **On-Demand Explanation Generation**: Explanations by LLM are generated only when users request them, ensuring responsiveness.  
- **Streamlined UI with Styling**: Displays cosine distances, rerank scores, legal metadata (act and section), document excerpts, and AI-generated explanations in a visually appealing manner.

## üíº Use Cases

- Legal researchers and practitioners seeking semantically relevant excerpts from legal text.  
- Developers exploring how to combine semantic search, neural reranking, and LLM explanation generation.  
- Organizations wanting explainable AI-powered legal search to enhance workflows.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **Data Loading**: Reads legal documents from bns.csv (with description, act, and section columns).  
- **Embedding Generation**: Uses Ollama‚Äôs embedding model to convert documents into vector representations.  
- **Indexing**: Builds an ANN index in ChromaDB optimized with HNSW parameters.  
- **Query Processing**: Retrieves candidate documents based on vector similarity.  
- **Reranking**: Applies a Cross-Encoder model to reorder candidate results by refined relevance score.  
- **Explanation Generation**: On user request, generates a concise relevance explanation per result using Ollama‚Äôs LLaMA 2 model.  
- **Display**: Presents results with metadata, similarity scores, reranking, and explanations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chitranshi18/Rag-based-LLM.git
   cd Rag-based-LLM

2. **Install required Python packages:**
   ```bash
      pip install streamlit pandas chromadb sentence-transformers
3. **Ensure Ollama server is running at the configured API URL:**
(http://localhost:11434/api by default) with the required models loaded.)

4. ** Place your bns.csv file in the root directory. The file should contain legal document descriptions and metadata (act, section, description).

## üöÄ Running the App

Launch the Streamlit app with:

    ```bash
      streamlit run app.py

** Enter your legal query in the input area.
** Adjust the "Number of top results" slider.
** Click "Run Semantic Search" to retrieve and rerank relevant legal documents.
** Click "Show Explanation" on any result to generate a concise AI explanation of relevance.
