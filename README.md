# üß† Legal Search with Explanations

A powerful Streamlit web application for semantic search over legal documents with AI-generated explanations. This project integrates cutting-edge embedding models, ANN search, neural reranking, and LLM-based explanation generation to help users efficiently find and understand relevant legal provisions.

## üöÄ Overview

- **Ollama Embeddings**: Uses `nomic-embed-text` to convert legal text into semantic vectors.
- **ChromaDB ANN Search**: Fast approximate nearest neighbor retrieval using HNSW indexing.
- **Cross-Encoder Reranking**: Refines initial results with `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`.
- **LLaMA 2 LLM Explanation Generation**: Generates concise, human-readable explanations using `llama2:latest`.
- **Streamlit UI**: Clean interface with query input, top-k result configuration, rerank scoring, and explanation display.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Efficient Embedding & Index Caching**: Avoids recomputation using `@st.cache_resource`.
- **Batch Processing with Progress Bar**: Real-time feedback during embedding and indexing.
- **Configurable Top-K Results**: Slider to adjust number of displayed and reranked results.

## üíº Use Cases

1. Legal researchers and practitioners seeking semantically relevant excerpts from legal text.
2. Developers exploring semantic search, neural reranking, and LLM explanation generation.
3. Organizations wanting explainable AI-powered legal search to enhance workflows.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: Reads legal documents from `bns.csv` (columns: description, act, section).
2. **Embedding Generation**: Converts documents into vector representations using Ollama.
3. **Indexing**: Builds ANN index in ChromaDB with HNSW optimization.
4. **Query Processing**: Retrieves candidates based on vector similarity.
5. **Reranking**: Applies Cross-Encoder model for refined relevance scoring.
6. **Explanation Generation**: Generates relevance explanations using LLaMA 2.
7. **Display**: Shows metadata, similarity scores, reranked results, and explanations.
